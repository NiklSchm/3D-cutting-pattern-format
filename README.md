This project was launched to develop a json-based standardized data format for the exchange of 3D cutting patterns and garments between 3D product development platforms.
The format is designed to be added onto a dxf-ASTM file of a 2D cutting pattern.
Parts and their geometric features (boundaries, internal cutouts, internal lines, holes) in a dxf-ASTM file are referred to
in the new format and additional information about affiliations, seams, seam types, stitches, iron lines, accessories and sewing directions are included.
Perspectively, the format can be used in conjunction with dxf-ASTM format and U3M-format for material data to represent an entire garment ready to be evaluated
in fit simulation.
